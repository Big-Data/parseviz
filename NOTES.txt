Differences in SD vs LTH

compound verbs.  AUX vs VC.  AUX gets head verb with everything else as modifiers.  but VC just chains out to the head verb.

numbers.  QUANT


deterministic labeling: looks good, except subj vs. object.

nice SD example

On Sunday, with a quarterback who had hitched his career to resurrecting the Saints and with a team playing nearly flawlessly, the Saints gave New Orleans a reason to do what it does better than any other American city: celebrate.

it gets an amazing verb chain at the end ...

do -ccomp-> does -ccomp-> celebrate
